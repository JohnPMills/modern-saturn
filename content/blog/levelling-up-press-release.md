Launched this week, Gamers vs Depression is aiming to establish whether esports can be used as a vehicle to deliver depression literacy programmes to young men around the world.

Gamers vs Depression founder, Dr John Mills said “We want to equip gamers with knowledge around mental health disorders so they can better support each other.”

The organisation is currently conducting a closed beta test of its programme and looking for around 200 volunteers to give feedback. Sam Williams, who is a co-project lead for Gamers vs. Depression and a pro-gamer for JLingz esports team said:

> “We are taking our time with the programme to get it right. We have a duty to the community with this to make sure this programme is as effective as possible.”

In addition to their depression literacy programme, Gamers vs. Depression also provide access to resources to improve gaming performance, improve sleep hygiene, create positive exercise routines, maintain a nutritious diet, as well as a parents guide to supporting gamers. “Everything is free to access” says Dr Mills. “We don’t believe in monetising people’s mental health”.
