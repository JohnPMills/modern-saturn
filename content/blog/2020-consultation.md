> This statement has two aims. The first is to highlight positive ways in which gaming could be used to **enhance depression literacy** and **help-seeking behaviours** in gamers. The second is to provoke wider discussion across the various stakeholders (e.g., gamers, mental health practitioners, academics) as to the ways in which we can incorporate gaming to enhance mental health literacy more broadly.

# Introduction

The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 6–8% of young people live with depression. Mental disorders more broadly, account for the highest proportion of disease among young people worldwide, with depression soon poised to become the largest single contributor to the burden of disease globally. Half of all lifetime mental health issues emerge by the age of 14 and three quarters by the age of 24. As such, adolescence is a critical time for the development of mental health literacy and support. If left unsupported, depression can contribute to early mortality and increased morbidity and has a significant negative impact on the quality of life and future vocational success for young people. 

Mental health literacy (MHL) is defined as “knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid recognition, management, and prevention” (Jorm et al., 1997). Evidence from previous reviews and meta-analyses suggest that MHL enhancement may increase early detection and help-seeking intentions. Previous research indicates that population-level mental health literacy is poor. This is especially true among adolescents (Coles et al., 2016; Lubman et al., 2017; Wright, McGorry, Harris, Jorm, & Pennell, 2006) and in particular, adolescent males (Haavik, Joa, Hatloy, Stain, & Langeveld, 2017). 

Adolescents face a range of barriers to seeking professional help including: stigmatising attitudes, having a preference for self-reliance, and lacking knowledge about the signs and symptoms of mental health problems or when and how to seek professional help. Adolescent males, in particular, also report excessive conformity to traditional masculine norms (Möller-Leimkühler, 2002). From a young age, the “boys don’t cry” narrative is perpetuated whereby boys are taught to be more stoic, to ignore symptoms, and to be self-sufficient (Mahalik et al., 2003). As such, showing weakness and vulnerability, and therefore seeking help, can be seen as a threat to such outdated views on masculinity (Schaub & Williams, 2007). Although the ability to recognise depression is generally low at a population level, research has shown that males are particularly poor (Haavik et al., 2017). Less than one in three young people feel equipped to recommend a peer seek help and this rate is also lower for males than females.

When young people do seek help for mental health problems, adolescents are most likely to turn to their friends or family. This help-seeking behaviour has implications for the type, quality, and timeliness of support received, as adolescents often lack the skills and knowledge to provide appropriate assistance to a friend with mental health problems. To be able to adequately support their peers, it is therefore critical that adolescents have good MHL. Hence, developing MHL programmes that improve young people’s knowledge about mental health, where to seek support, and reduce stigmatisation is critical (Clement et al., 2015; Gulliver, Griffiths, & Christensen, 2010)

Although there have been previous attempts to train MHL, attrition and efficacy vary greatly between programmes. More recently (Vella et al., 2019), has used sport as a vehicle to engage adolescent males to develop MHL. By utilising an already intrinsically motivating activity, Vella and colleagues have demonstrated that a short workshop (i.e., < 1 hour) can have long-lasting and positive effects on MHL. Due to the ongoing situation with Covid-19, however, such promising lines of enquiry have been thwarted. Further, due to the conditions required to keep safe during the global pandemic, it is also thought that we may experience a global mental health crisis (REF). 

With social distancing measures in place, many people are also thought to have turned to team-based video games as a way of maintaining social connection during lockdown. Online gaming platform, Steam, reported a 100%  increase in daily users, while streaming platform, Twitch reported their user base had grown from 16million to 24million daily users. Figures pre-lockdown report that 84% of adolescent boys (13-17 years of age) play video games each week. Despite being stereotypically viewed as an individual activity, adolescent males are thought to spend 83% of their time gaming with existing friends either online or in person. The evidence also suggests that one in three adolescent males have made someone whom they consider a friend solely through online gaming. Video gameplay, then, particularly over online networks, is an important activity through which boys form and maintain friendships with others. Given the widespread use of gaming and promising studies already conducted, Shoemaker, Tully, Niendam, and Peterson (2015) describe the therapeutic use of video games as the “next big thing in child and adolescent psychiatry”.  

Within the present study, we aim to adopt the basic premise of utilising an intrinsically engaging activity (i.e., online gaming) to develop depression literacy and social connection in adolescent males. 

# Consultation

This consultation was initiated by the Team Research Lab and attended by professional gamers, recreational gamers, streamers, researchers, and mental health practitioners from across the United Kingdom and Australia. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the consultation was conducted via video conferencing platform Zoom and lasted for approximately two hours. The consultation focused on answering five key questions members from the Team Research Lab had highlighted as important to understand before a mental health literacy training programme could be developed. Each of these questions and a summary of the responses provided follow. 

## 1. What are the common mental health issues you are aware of? 

While speaking to a few members within the esports community, they helped identify certain mental health issues. They described issues like low self-esteem, resulting in loss of sleep and poor eating patterns. Also, high-stress levels related to performance at a professional esports level leads to a negative impact across the team and anxiety. Due to the duration that gamers spend playing games, we also identified that there may be a lack of true social interaction with friends which leads to ‘feeling down’ or depressed. Despite not being a mental health issue, the lack of understanding of mental health is a common problem that has been seen within the gaming community. This is also heightened by the fact that it is difficult to identify signs of poor mental health if you haven’t met the people you are friends with online in real life. However, the anonymity of the interaction between friends also helps people be more open about their issues.  

We identified that common signs and symptoms that current gamers found was behaviour change, loss of appetite before and post games, lack of sleep or poor sleeping patterns.

## 2. How common do you think mental health issues are in our community?

We found that nearly every team or player has experienced themselves or teammates suffering from mental health issues like anxiety or depression. Also, not many players are resilient to mental health issues, they shut down and stop communicating with teammates about their personal issues. It’s not nice when this happens as for many of us, our teams also act as friendship groups.

## 3. As a leader for your respective team, do you have any suggestions for how we could integrate a mental health literacy training programme into a team like yours? 

There was a general lack of understanding and knowledge that has been identified as a problem by the leaders of the respective teams, therefore, the sessions should integrate basic mental health and mental health first-aid. Needs to fit in around 30-40 hours of practice for professional players, with social gamers spending about 15 hours a week gaming. 

## 3a. What would the program involve (eg content, specific activities)?

The program should include an assessment of mental health literacy and how to determine poor mental health. This could be done by reading between the lines at the content of the conversation and through changes in appearance or mood. Recognising sleeping patterns and helping sleep hygiene, using a low-intensity exercise programme, and nutrition should be encouraged.

## 3b. Who would present the program?

Reported to us that it needs to be people of a similar demographic, with credible and lived experienced to deliver sessions. Sports psychologists are ideal, not player to player or coach to player as peer to peer may lead to feelings of intimidation, especially at a professional level. At a more social level, peer to peer may be more accepted. A combination of the two would be ideal. 

## 4. How would you find out about such a programme?

Advertising this programme should be through twitter and discord with the possibility to sponsor Twitch/YouTube streamers that may advertise the service through panels on their stream pro bono. Also, word of mouth could be particularly strong as many gamers know other people that may need a similar programme to help them or someone they know with their mental health issues. 

## 5. How would you prefer to attend (eg F2F, online, synchronous, asynchronous)?

Using programs like Discord or TeamSpeak to attend sessions is an ideal possibility, with Discord potentially being used with webcams should players choose to identify themselves to each other.

## 5a. How long would the training last?

We identified that an ideal duration for the sessions is to be around 30 minutes for a maximum of two hours to train participants to recognise and read signs of poor mental health. A website should also be made to direct participants to places get instant 24/7 help (e.g., the Samaritans).

## Conclusion

The group identified that there is a need to enhance mental health literacy in gamers, citing how common it is for gamers they knew to experience issues. It was suggested that a particular focus should be paid to adolescent males due to the volume of diagnoses, major concerns, and the medium proposed. Young\[er] sport and performance psychologists who understand the gaming environment and experiences of the eventual demographic were identified as being optimal to deliver content. Programme delivery should be between 30-minutes and 2hours, depending on medium. A combination of asynchronous methods such as YouTube videos and discord communities, with synchronous gaming support sessions were identified as being the ideal approach.

# The Programme: Gamers vs. Depression

Based on feedback from this consultation, we developed the following aim: 

The aim of this project is to enhance depression literacy and provide peer support to young men through esports.

To achieve this aim we have two objectives. Our first objective is to develop and evaluate a depression literacy peer support training programme using esports. The programme focuses on playing as part of a team of like-minded individuals in a safe and supportive environment to promote downtime, socialisation, and fun. 

Our second objective is to create a platform which places those who have undertaken the training programme together in teams around their interests and game of choice. As part of these regular sessions, teams will play against each other in ‘friendlies’ where players are encouraged to support each other (i.e., a self-help group) while gaming. We also hope to use these sessions to create multiple conditions which provide advice on sleep hygiene, routine, nutrition and caffeine intake, and exercise, much in the same way as recreational sports would usually.

 As a programme that focuses on the mental health literacy of young men, we hope to create a team-based environment, which is comparable to sport. Such an approach to tackling mental health literacy has previously been evidenced as effective by Vella and colleagues (date). We also hope to utilise role models from the world of professional esports and streaming to add credibility to the programme. 

## Visual Communication

We have also sought advice around creating clear imagery around the programme in order to be attractive to gamers, whilst also demonstrating credibility in the programme. The design we settled on was of a black dog (i.e., a well-known symbol for depression) playing a games console (see below). Mascots are common in esports, and such imagery helps establish us as cultural insiders.

## Safeguarding

We appreciate the need to create safeguards for participants and propose a number of measures to help make the platform a safe, positive, and supportive environment. First, we plan to ask participants to meet via video conferencing software. By removing anonymity it is expected that this will limit the number of participants attempting to join the platform in bad faith. Second, we will create a report feature on the platform, so participants can anonymously report suspicious activities within their groups. Third, participants will be grouped by age when placed into teams. A difference in age of two calendar years will be adhered to where possible. Fourth, a transfer request function will be added to permit participants to change teams should they wish. Finally, we will connect with participants randomly to ask about their experiences of the platform. 

## Transitioning out of the platform

We understand and appreciate the risk of dependency such a programme may create in helping participants in dealing with their mental health issues. As such, at the end of the programme, we will provide support and guidance around where additional support can be found. Further, we will encourage participants to reduce contact time and finally connect them with fellow leavers who wish to maintain some level of contact.
