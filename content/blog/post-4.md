In recent research there has been emerging links between diet and good quality nutrition and mental health status. Studies have shown that diet is one of many different pieces in the prevention of poor mental health and the promotion of positive mental health. 

You can help improve your mental health by ensuring that you get a healthy balanced diet as deficiencies in micronutrients have implicated a significant number of mental health problems. For example, by consuming green leafy vegetables like kale and spinach you consume folic acid, which a deficiency in has been shown to cause anxiety, depression and psychosis.

We know that energy drinks like Monster and Red Bull are especially prominent within the gaming community however in recent studies and reports published by the World Health Organisation, there are serious health risks that are a consequence of energy drink consumption. 

Potential risks associated with energy drink consumption include:

*   Caffeine (which can lead to a number of symptoms, including palpitations, high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, convulsions and, in some cases, even death)

*   Type 2 diabetes – as high consumption of caffeine reduces insulin sensitivity

*   Neurological and cardiovascular system effects in children and adolescents

*   Sensation-seeking behaviour

*   Use and dependence on other harmful substances

*   Poor dental health

*   Obesity (Combined with the sedentary nature of gaming is an even bigger risk)
