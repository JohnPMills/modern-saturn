          Gamers vs Depression (GVD) is a global mental health programme that
          uses gaming to teach young men about the importance of mental health,
          self-care, and social connections.


          With support from men’s health charity Movember, Gamers vs Depression
          is aiming to establish whether esports can be used as a vehicle to
          deliver mental health literacy programmes to young men around the
          world. We also aim to reduce stigma and increase help seeking
          behaviours in gamers.


          Our community is a place where gamers can feel empowered to talk
          freely about any problems or concerns they may have with likeminded
          peers, without fear of judgement, prejudice, or discrimination. We
          game together, chat, and support one another. It's that simple.

          In addition to our depression literacy programme, we also provide
          access to resources and training developed in the world of performance
          sport including improving sleep hygiene, creating positive exercise
          routines, and maintaining a nutritious diet.


          In doing so, we are equipping gamers with the tools to manage their
          own mental health and the ability to spot the signs of distress in
          others.


          Gamers vs Depression is generously supported by men’s health charity
          Movember. The organisation was founded in 2019 and currently has three
          members of staff, based in the South-East of England (UK).
