          Gamers vs Depression (GVD) is a global mental health project that uses
          gaming to teach young men about the importance of mental health,
          self-care, and social connections.


          With support from men’s health charity Movember, Gamers vs Depression
          is aiming to establish whether esports can be used as a vehicle to
          deliver mental health literacy programmes to young men around the
          world. We also aim to reduce stigma and increase help seeking
          behaviours in gamers.


          Our community is a place where gamers can feel empowered to talk
          freely about any problems or concerns they may have with likeminded
          peers, without fear of judgement, prejudice, or discrimination. We
          game together, chat, and support one another. It's that simple.

          In addition to our depression literacy programme, we also provide
          access to resources and training developed in the world of performance
          sport including improving sleep hygiene, creating positive exercise
          routines, and maintaining a nutritious diet.


          In doing so, we are equipping gamers with the tools to manage their
          own mental health and the ability to spot the signs of distress in
          others.


          Gamers vs Depression is part of That Awfully Good Community Interest
          Company (12894917) and generously supported by men’s health charity
          Movember. That Awfully Good Community Interest Company was founded by
          <a href="https://www.johnpmills.com">Dr John P. Mills</a> in 2020 with
          his fellow Director Nancy Borley. Dr Stewart Vella, Tristan
          Mayglothling, Henry Titly-Wall, and Kyran Clements also act as
          advisors to the organisation, supporting the development and success
          of our various projects. See our <a
