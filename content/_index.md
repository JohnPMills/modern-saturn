          There is no denying that life can be tough. We're all in this journey
          together and there is a lot more we can often do to look after
          ourselves and the people we care about. At GVD, we provide a platform
          for gamers experiencing tough times or who'd like to support those who

        content: "Thereâ€™s an assumption that living a healthy lifestyle involves eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly and getting adequate sleep. But social connection is rarely mentioned, even though it is pivotal to both our mental and physical wellbeing. Research suggests that loneliness is rising dramatically, and that an absence or lack of human connection could be more harmful to your health than obesity, smoking and high blood pressure.\_ \n"
