    content: "Being a point of contact for conversation about mental health can be very rewarding however it can also be time consuming and emotionally overwhelming. Often being part of a support network for someone who is struggling with their mental health can be stressful and take a toll on your own mental health, so it is important to be aware of this when you are offering support, and being in the right head space yourself.\_\n\nThink carefully about how you will look after your own wellbeing and make sure you also have an appropriate support system in place. Having someone that you can talk to about the issues you are dealing with is crucial for you to be part of someone else's support system.\_Discussing subjects or traumatic events that others close to you have experienced can have an impact on your own mental health, especially if you're feeling unwell.\n\nLearning self-care techniques and knowing what lifestyle choices affect mental health can be a great way to manage the symptoms of mental ill health. Also, by being able to recognise that you are struggling early, and then using these self-care techniques, it may also help prevent the problems from developing and getting worse. Just remember, it is unlikely that any of these will be an instant solution, recovering from a mental health disorder, or preventing one takes a lot of time, energy and work. So don't be hard on yourself.\n\n## Stay aware of your mental health\n\nTell people what helps. By letting the ones around you know what support you need from them, they can be more aware of how to help you with your mental health struggles. Whether it's as simple as them listening to you and talking to you, or being aware of your triggers, just telling them what you would like from them is a good way to help start a good support network.\_\n\nKnow your early warning signs. Try and be aware of how you are feeling daily, this can be done by keeping a mood diary or just taking some time to be reflective on how your day was. It can be useful to reflect on how you are feeling so you can access support as soon as you feel it's necessary.\n\n## Nourish your social life\n\nFeeling connected to other people is really important as it can help you feel valued and wanted, as well as helping increase self-confidence. If you can, try and spend some more time connecting with your friends and family. Gaming is great for developing friendships and social connection, gaming together with people, sharing that same combined interest is a great way to develop supporting friends around you. There are a lot of different discord communities that you can join if you are struggling to meet people, including our own GvD discord that you can access through our website.\n\n## Peer Support\n\nWhen experiencing mental health problems, it can feel like no one understands what you are going through, however peer support brings together people who’ve had similar experiences to support each other. Peer support offers a lot of benefits such as:\n\n*   Feeling accepted for who you are\n\n*   Increased self confidence\n\n*   Meeting new people and using your experienced to help others\n\n*   Fnding out new information and places for support\n\n*   Challenging stigma and discrimination\n\nPeer support groups are usually based locally, in the UK, Mind offer peers support groups, however, internationally it would be worth researching local peer support groups if you feel like it would help you.\n\n## Make time for therapeutic activities\n\nTherapeutic activities and techniques like relaxation, mindfulness and meditation can all be practised alone and help with your own mental health.\_\n\n*   Relaxation - Find something that helps you relax. This can be doing anything, for example, going for a walk or taking a shower but as long as it works for you, make sure you set aside time to do it.\_\n\n*   Mindfulness - Mindfulness is a therapeutic technique that involves being more aware of the present moment, both the world around you, for example, the temperature in your room, but also inside like your feelings and thoughts. Practising mindfulness can help you become more aware of your own moods and reactions, however this takes time to perform well, and it doesn't work for everyone.\n\n*   Meditation - meditation is an umbrella term for the many ways to a relaxed state of being. There are many types of meditation and relaxation techniques that are called meditation. Finding the right one for you can be really helpful. However, guided meditation is the most common and as the name suggests, you can be guided through the steps. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process may result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.\n\n## Look after your physical health\n\nBy looking after your physical health, it can help manage your own mental health too.\_\\*   Get enough sleep - make sure you try to set and keep to a sleeping schedule, this can help you have the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences.\n\n*   Keep physically active - regular exercise doesn't have to be very strenuous or high intensity to be effective. Simple and gentle exercises like going for a short walk can help keep you physically active. Exercise helps increase cortisol release, which helps us manage stress. It also makes us feel more tired at the end of the day which helps promote good sleep.\_\_\n\n*   Avoid drugs and alcohol - When struggling with mental ill health, it can often lead to a desire to use drugs or alcohol to deal with difficult feelings, however in the long run, they can make you feel a lot worse.\_\n\n*   Eat healthily - Getting 3 healthy, balanced meals a day, can make a big difference to how well you feel. Improving your diet may help to improve your mood, give you more energy, and help you think more clearly.\n"

    content: "You are not an expert, but it is important to care about your friends and the community around you. You can do this by asking people how they are feeling, pay attention to their response and ask how they would like to be supported.\_\n\nAvoid intrusive questions, treat everyone fairly and make yourself available just to listen. Empathise with them, listen and seek understanding of what they are going through but don't feel pressured to find them answers.\_\_\n\nFor example, if someone wants to speak to you about their mental health, ask them to tell you how they are feeling, appreciate that it is extremely difficult for them to speak about what they are going through and reassure them that it is positive that they want to talk about what they are going through.\_\n\nA good way to wrap up the conversation is to provide them with the details of their local ‘Mind’ so help signpost her to sources of support instead of you telling them what you think is best. This way they know they are getting the best support possible but they also know you are there for them and they can talk to you about their issues.\n\n\nThe support that family and friends can give play a very important role for someone recovering from depression. Here are some more ways how you can help:\n\n## How to help someone struggling with depression\n\nYou can support people that you suspect are suffering from depression by encouraging people to start small and build up their energy levels, small amounts of physical activity has been proven to be extremely effective. Listening to them and just talking to them can help them talk through their issues and knowing that they have someone they can talk to is a huge step for anyone.\n\n\n*   Support them to get help in their own time. Don't force anyone to get help if they don't want it, but reassure them it's okay to ask for help if they need it and that there are plenty of people that want to help them.\n\n*   Be open about depression. Lots of people find it very difficult to open up about how they're feeling. If you are open about depression, your friends or family knows that it's okay to talk about whatever they're going through.\n\n*   Try and keep in touch. It can be hard for your friend or family member to have the energy to keep in touch. Even just a short text message or phone call, it will let them know that you are thinking of them and to them it can mean the world and make a big difference to how they feel.\_\n\n*   Don't be critical. If you put the blame on them, or too much pressure, it can make things much worse. Even if you may struggle to understand why they can't just snap out of it, the person that you are helping is probably being very critical and harsh towards themselves already.\n"
