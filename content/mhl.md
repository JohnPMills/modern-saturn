    content: "## Know Your Teammates!\n\nJust think about them in your head, feel free to note some of the\_characteristics down.\_\n\nThink about and identify characteristics about a friend or teammate you play with.\_\n\nAre they: Aggressive players, vocal, calm, passive, loud, confident etc.\_\n\nThese personality traits can be used to identify if someone is going through MH issues. Noticing when they aren’t acting themselves, if they play the game differently, get frustrated easily etc.\n\nBeing able to recognise the signs of mental health is imperative to help people that might be suffering with mental health problems.\_\n\n## Recognising Signs\n\nLook at the case studies below, highlight signs of\_[negative mental health](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=63)\_that you might recognise. There are two different types of mental health illness here, depression and anxiety.\_\n\nCase Study 1:\n\nBrad is a 18 year-old who recently started University, and is struggling to make new friends. He often spends most of his time in his dorm room, playing Valorant with his old friends from College. He rarely leaves his room to even attend his lectures and tries to complete all his work from his room. In an attempt to meet new people, he joined the University Discord server but he has a hard time concentrating on the interaction with new people because he is busy worrying about what people think of him, and assume that they will find him boring. He feels his heart rate rise, palms become sweaty and starts stuttering his words out. After the interaction, he leaves the Discord server and replays the conversation over and over again in his head, focusing on the ‘stupid’ things he said. Since starting University, he has been isolating more, turning down invitations from his roommate to go eat or hang out, ignoring his phone when it rings, and habitually skipping class.\n\n## Symptoms of Mental Health Problems\n\nThere are usually three types of signs that categorise symptoms of mental health problems:\n\n**PERSONALITY SIGNS**: Noticeable changes in mood or energy levels. Increased anger, aggression or irritability. Compulsive or reckless behaviour. Difficulty concentrating.\n\n**PHYSICAL SIGNS**:\_Sleeping less. Relying on substances like alcohol. Appetite changes.\n\n**AUDITORY SIGNS:**\_Sounding withdrawn. Overly quiet compared to usual. Not saying hello when they first join.\n"

    content: "## Introduction to Stigma\n\nStigma is when assumptions are made about mental health and how it affects someone's behaviour. Therefore, people with mental health issues feel isolated and ashamed due to the stigma of mental health issues. You saw in the module video, how the stigma surrouding mental health even affects A-List Celebrities like Ryan Reynolds, so stamping out stigma is crucial in trying to improve the life of those suffering with mental health issues.\_\n\nFear or misunderstanding is the usual cause for stigmatising attitudes, often leading to prejudice against those suffering with mental health issues. This lack of understanding is one of the main reasons why many people don't consider mental health issues to be an actual illness, causing people who are suffering to have feelings of hopelessness and shame when struggling to cope with their situation, creating a barrier to diagnosis and treatment.\n\nStigma prevents 40% of people suffering with anxiety or depression from seeking help for their mental health issues.\_\n\n## Different Types of Stigma\n\nStigma often comes from a lack of understanding or fear. Often misleading social media representations of\_[mental health disorders](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=85)\_contribute to both those factors. While the public may be more accepting of the medical treatment of\_[mental health disorders](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=85), many people view those with mental ill health in a negative way, or subconsciously change the way they behave or act towards people who are suffering with\_[mental health disorders](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=85).\_\n\nThree types of different stigma have been identified:\n\n*   Public Stigma:\_involves the negative or discriminatory attitudes that others have about mental ill health.\n\n*   Self-stigma:\_refers to the negative attitudes, including internalized shame, that people with\_[mental health disorders](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=85)\_have about their own condition.\n\n*   Institutional Stigma: is more systemic, involving policies of government and private organizations that intentionally or unintentionally limit opportunities for people with\_[mental health disorders](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=85). Examples include lower funding for mental health research or fewer mental health services relative to other health care.\n\nStigma not only directly affects individuals with mental ill health but also the loved ones who support them, often including their family members.\n\n\nUnfortunately, certain stigma will surround mental health, but everyday, you have the opportunity to show the people around you that they are able to talk about their issues with you and slowly you can break down the stigma in your friendship group.\n\n## How you can help reduce the stigma\n\nStigma is a big reason why so many people deal with mental health problems alone. Breaking down that stigma is crucial in developing a healthy environment for people to feel comfortable to talk about the problems they are dealing with and get the help that they need. Research has also suggested knowing or having contact with someone with mental illness is one of the best ways to reduce stigma.\_\n\nTry and think of some ways to let people know you are there for them and are willing to support them with zero judgement.\n\nBelow are Seven things you can do to reduce the stigma around mental health.\_\n\n1.  Know the facts. Educate yourself about mental ill health (completing this programme is a great step to achieving this).\n\n2.  Be aware of your attitudes and behaviours. Examine your own judgemental thinking, think about how you have spoken to people before if they have said something that you might think was a bit different to usual, and if you dismissed how they were feeling.\n\n3.  Choose the words that you use carefully. What and how you speak can affect the attitudes of others.\n\n4.  Educate your friends and the people around you. By passing on the facts and attitudes you have, it will lead to more people challenging the myths and stereotypes surrounding mental\_health disorders.\n\n5.  Try and focus on the positives, mental ill health in anyone, is only a small part of anyone’s much larger picture.\n\n6.  Support people, treat everyone with the dignity and respect they deserve; offer support and encouragement.\_\n\n7.  Include everyone, do not discriminate against anyone with these health issues.\n\n## Harmful effects of stigma and discrimination\n\nStigma often contributes to worsening symptoms, and reduced the likelihood of those who need help to seek help.\_\n\nEffects of stigma and discrimination include:\n\n*   reduced hope\n\n*   lower self-esteem\n\n*   increased symptoms\n\n*   difficulties with maintaining and creating social relationships\n\n*   reduced likelihood of staying with current treatment\n"

    content: "## Depression Meaning\n\nOne of the main mental health problems that face a large number of people in the UK every year is depression.\_\n\nDepression is a low mood that lasts for a long time, and affects your everyday life. In its mildest form, depression can mean just being low or sad. It doesn't stop you from going about normal life but makes everything harder to do and see, less worthwhile.\_\n\nAt its most severe, depression can be life-threatening because it can make you feel suicidal or simply give up the will to live.\_\n\n\nDepression has a lot of causes and triggers while affecting people in different ways. Signs and\_[symptoms of depression](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=75)\_are different for everyone, but there are some common symptoms that people struggling with depression have reported.\n\nThroughout this module, you will learn the effects and\_[causes of depression](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=76), and also learn different methods on how to help people that are struggling and how to help yourself if you believe you are suffering with depression.\_\n\n## Symptoms of Depression\n\nSometimes depression can be quite hard to recognise when you are suffering with it. Maybe you can’t put your finger on it, but you aren’t feeling yourself. Struggling to cope everyday looks different for everyone too, people suffering with depression will experience a range of different symptoms. Some signs and symptoms of depressions include:\n\n*   Lacking energy or feeling tired\n\n*   Feeling exhausted all the time regardless of the amount of sleep you get\n\n*   Finding it hard to think clearly\n\n*   Finding it hard to concentrate\n\n*   Feeling restless and agitated\n\n*   Feeling tearful, wanting to cry all the time\n\n*   Not wanting to talk to or be with people\n\n*   Not wanting to do things you usually enjoy\n\n*   Using alcohol or drugs to cope with feelings\n\n*   Finding it hard to cope with everyday things and tasks\n\n*   Experiencing ‘burn out’\n\nThese are only some symptoms of depression, you may be experiencing different symptoms, but if you think these symptoms sound like you or someone you know, then you should get in touch with some of the help-contacts on our website so you can get some further help.\n\n## Causes of Depression\n\nDepression can be caused by a variety of different distresses which vary a lot between different people. A combination of different distresses and factors may cause their depression. It is also possible that people find themselves becoming depressed without any obvious reason.\_\n\nMind UK identified some common possible causes of depression that include:\n\n*   Childhood experiences\n\n*   Life events\n\n*   Physical health problems\n\n*   Genetic inheritance\n\n*   Medication, recreational drugs and alcohol\n\n*   Sleep, diet and exercise.\_\n\n## Childhood Experiences\n\nDifficult experiences in your childhood have been shown to make you vulnerable to experiencing depression later in life. Experiences like\_\n\n*   Physical, sexual or emotional abuse\n\n*   Neglect\n\n*   The loss of someone close to you\n\n*   Traumatic events\n\n*   Unstable family situation.\n\nExperiencing any of these can have a massive impact on your self-esteem and less likely to have learned to cope with difficult emotions and situations.\n\n## Life Events\n\nDepression can often be caused by stressful or traumatic events that someone may experience in everyday life.\_\n\nEvents that cause this could be:\_\n\n*   Losing your job or unemployment\n\n*   The end of a relationship\n\n*   Bereavement/loss\n\n*   Major life changes like changing job, moving house or getting married\n\n*   Being physically or sexually assaulted\n\n*   Being bullied or abused.\n\nFeeling depressed is not just caused by the negative experiences themselves, but often how we deal with them. If you don't have much support during these times, it can be very hard to cope with the difficult emotions that come with these events.\n\n## Physical Health Problems\n\nPoor physical health can contribute to your risk of developing depression, especially ones that can be difficult to manage, having a big impact on your emotions. Health problems including:\n\n*   Chronic physical health problems\n\n*   Life-threatening physical illnesses\n\n*   Physical health problems that significantly change your lifestyle.\n\nSome physical health problems that can cause depression:\n\n*   Conditions affecting the brain and nervous system\n\n*   Hormonal problems\n\n*   Low blood sugar\n\n*   Sleep problems.\n\nIf you are struggling with any of these issues, your doctor may be able to suggest some best ways to help cope with the mental health ramifications of the conditions.\n\n## Generic Inheritance\n\nAlthough there hasn't been any specific genes for depression identified, research has shown that if you have a close family member with depression, you are more likely to experience depression yourself.\n\n## Medication, recreational drugs and alcohol.\n\nOften side effects of medication include depression, if you are feeling depressed after starting any kind of medication, it is useful to check the information leaflet to see whether depression is a side effect. If you think the drug is causing depression, it is worth speaking to your doctor about taking an alternative, especially if you are expecting your treatment to last some time.\_\n\nAlcohol and recreational drugs both can cause depression. Although they can help with social connection, and you might use them to initially use them to make yourself feel better, they often hide the true cause of your depression.\n\n## Sleep, Diet and Exercise\n\nA poor diet, lack of sleep and exercise can often affect your mood, making it harder for you to cope with the experiences and stressors that can often cause depression. Although a poor diet, or not getting enough sleep or exercise cannot directly cause depression, they can make you more vulnerable to developing it.\_\n\nFor more information about sleep hygiene, a healthy diet and good exercise, check our website for the respective pages.\n"

    content: "## Talking about Mental Health\_\n\nWhen talking to someone who you think is struggling with their mental health, it is important to understand that you are not an expert, but it is important to care about your friends and the community around you. You can do this by asking people how they are feeling, pay attention to their response and ask how they would like to be supported.\_\n\nAvoid intrusive questions, treat everyone fairly and make yourself available just to listen. Empathise with them, listen and seek understanding of what they are going through but don't feel pressured to find them answers.\_\_\n\nFor example, if someone wants to speak to you about their mental health, ask them to tell you how they are feeling, appreciate that it is extremely difficult for them to speak about what they are going through and reassure them that it is positive that they want to talk about what they are going through.\_\n\nA good way to wrap up the conversation is to provide them with the details of their local ‘Mind’ so help signpost her to sources of support instead of you telling them what you think is best. This way they know they are getting the best support possible but they also know you are there for them and they can talk to you about their issues.\_\n\n## Helping someone in crisis\n\nIf you think someone is in crisis, encourage the individual to seek support from Samaritans - 116123 from any phone in any country, or phone the emergency services if you are worried someone will harm themselves or others. The most important thing you can do in these situations is to listen and to support them to stay safe. Not everyone experiencing mental health problems will reach a crisis.\_\n\nIf you reside in the UK, there are training programmes available including ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) and Mental Health First Aid training.\_\n\nAs usually through online gaming you can't physically be in contact with people, having contact information of family members when you know your friends or the people around you are suffering from mental health issues can also be extremely useful if you believe they are in crisis.\_\n\n## Talking to someone who is suicidal\n\nThere are a number of different things you can do if someone tells you that they are self-harming or feeling suicidal to help them.\n\n*   Ask open questions, invite them to give a more in-depth response than just a yes/no.\n\n*   Give them time, you might feel anxious to hear their answers, but being with them and helping them feel comfortable gives them the time they need to think and respond.\n\n*   Take them seriously.\n\n*   Try not to judge, you might feel shocked, upset or frightened, but it's important not to blame the person for how they are feeling: they may have taken a big step by even telling you about it.\_\n\n*   Don't skirt around the topic, suicide is still somewhat of a taboo subject, which can make it hard for people to pen up and feel understood. Direct questions can help someone to start talking about their feelings.\_\n"

    content: "## What is Gaming Addiction?\n\nThere have been some key stages of gaming addiction suggested, where initial exposure to a game starts the process to becoming addicted. Initial exposure to the game leads to a deeper interest, and then a growing obsession which then leads to addiction.\n\nGaming has both negative and positive effects on mental health. Gaming itself doesn’t have too many negative effects on mental health, however gaming addiction has been shown to be detrimental to mental health.\_\n\nGaming addiction has been recognised as an addictive behaviour by the World Health Organisation. They characterised it by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.\_\n\nIt is possible to be at risk of or developing an addiction to gaming in a similar way to other addictions to substances such as drugs or alcohol. Symptoms of gaming addiction include:\n\n*   Constantly thinking about or wanting to play the game\n\n*   Feeling irritable and restless when you’re not playing\n\n*   Lying about how much time you’ve spent playing or playing in secret such as in the middle of the night\n\n*   Tiredness, headaches or hand pain from too much screen time and the use of controllers or mouse and keyboard.\_\n\n*   Not paying attention to your personal hygiene, for example not washing often or not eating enough\n\n*   Not being able to quit or even play less of the game\n\n*   Having problems at work, school or home because of your gaming.\_\n\n*   Using gaming to ease bad moods and feelings\n\n## Initial Exposure\n\nInitial Exposure is when an individual has very positive early experiences with the video game, where the enjoyment and fascination with such a game develops very quickly. For example, they may have started playing Fortnite for the first time, their first ‘Battle Royale’ genre, which they instantly enjoyed and wanted to play more of.\n\n## Deeper Interest\n\nGaming begins to take up a significantly greater position in the individual's life, usually requiring a greater investment in time and money. Other activities that the individual might have done previously may be less significant to the person now. Developing a deeper interest into gaming is fine, it is how recreational gamers that have no intention of becoming esports professionals take that first step into esports.\n\n## Growing Obsession\n\nStarting to become obsessive over gaming is usually when large lifestyle changes occur. Increasingly neglecting relationships, sleep, nutrition often happens at this point as the great majority of the individual’s free time is now taken up with gaming. Their thoughts are becoming increasingly solely based around gaming.\n\n## Addiction\n\nGaming now has become the individuals dominant interest, with most of their free time taken up by gaming. They spend most of their day focused on it, either gaming or wishing they were when they weren’t. This can often be at the cost of academic or work progress and dietary and sleeping patterns are likely to be hugely affected by constant gaming. Slowly, they may find themselves disconnecting from the relationships around them IRL, and instead relying on the social connection that gaming brings.\n\nDespite this, recreational gaming rarely leads to addiction, it can be a harmless, healthy aspect of an individual's life. Often gaming is portrayed as this harmful activity that only children should do and we completely disagree with this portayal, however if gaming does become addictive, it can be caused by\_[mental health disorders](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=85).\n\n## Preventing Gaming Addiction\n\nIt can often be hard to identify when you are crossing the line between having fun with your hobby and getting to the point where you are addicted to gaming, but there are different things that gamers can do to make sure that they don’t become addicted to gaming.\_\n\n\n1.  By setting time limits for gaming and sticking to them, it prevents excessive gaming where you might sacrifice things like sleep and daily hygiene.\_\n\n2.  Try and do other activities every day including exercise, as this helps lower the health risks of sitting and playing for long stretches of time.\_\n\n3.  Set a sleep schedule and try and keep to it, don’t let gaming be a reason why you stay up late.\n\n## Negative effects that gaming has on mental health\n\nAlthough gaming has a lot of positive impacts on mental health, excessive playing of video games can result in a neglect of other aspects of your life. Apart from gaming addiction that we previously mentioned, excessive or unhealthy gaming habits may contribute to worsening of existing or underlying mental health problems, including:\n\n*   Emotional suppression:\_\n\n*   Anxiety and depressive symptoms\n\n*   Social disconnection\n\n*   Relationship issues\n\n*   Decreased motivation in school and work\n\n*   Dopamine addiction\_\n\nThese are some of the potential side effects of video games on mental health, though most of these can be avoided by following the advice suggested in\_[preventing gaming addiction](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=81).\n\n## Positive effects that gaming has on mental health\n\nGaming can help remove stress from everyday life by reducing thoughts on issues that you are dealing with on a regular basis, and help improve your mood.\_\n\nGaming is also great for social interaction with friends, combating social isolation where people might be more alone without many, if any friends, and can find people they have common interests with to create deeper friendships.\_\n\nGaming has also been shown to be a good distraction from IRL issues, giving a feeling of achievement. It is important to differentiate how the distraction can either give the feeling of escapism or coping, which both have varying effects on mental health. This feeling of escapism through the distraction that gamers find playing video games provides a relief from the unpleasant realities they may be experiencing IRL. However, escaping from these issues often are a precursor to developing depression tendencies rather than actually dealing with the issue they are having. Disengaging from the coping strategy has been found to cause negative outcomes such as increased stress and emotional suppression. However, using gaming as an effective coping strategy through problem solving and social connection and support has been shown to be effective in reducing stress and increasing emotional support.\n"

    content: "Being a point of contact for conversation about mental health can be very rewarding however it can also be time consuming and emotionally overwhelming. Often being part of a support network for someone who is struggling with their mental health can be stressful and take a toll on your own mental health, so it is important to be aware of this when you are offering support, and being in the right head space yourself.\_\n\nThink carefully about how you will look after your own wellbeing and make sure you also have an appropriate support system in place. Having someone that you can talk to about the issues you are dealing with is crucial for you to be part of someone else's support system.\_Discussing subjects or traumatic events that others close to you have experienced can have an impact on your own mental health, especially if you're feeling unwell.\n\nLearning self-care techniques and knowing what lifestyle choices affect mental health can be a great way to manage the symptoms of mental ill health. Also, by being able to recognise that you are struggling early, and then using these self-care techniques, it may also help prevent the problems from developing and getting worse. Just remember, it is unlikely that any of these will be an instant solution, recovering from a mental health disorder, or preventing one takes a lot of time, energy and work. So don't be hard on yourself.\n\n## Stay aware of your mental health\n\nTell people what helps. By letting the ones around you know what support you need from them, they can be more aware of how to help you with your mental health struggles. Whether it's as simple as them listening to you and talking to you, or being aware of your triggers, just telling them what you would like from them is a good way to help start a good support network.\_\n\nKnow your early warning signs.

    content: "You are not an expert, but it is important to care about your friends and the community around you. You can do this by asking people how they are feeling, pay attention to their response and ask how they would like to be supported.\_\n\nAvoid intrusive questions, treat everyone fairly and make yourself available just to listen. Empathise with them, listen and seek understanding of what they are going through but don't feel pressured to find them answers.\_\_\n\nFor example, if someone wants to speak to you about their mental health, ask them to tell you how they are feeling, appreciate that it is extremely difficult for them to speak about what they are going through and reassure them that it is positive that they want to talk about what they are going through.\_\n\nA good way to wrap up the conversation is to provide them with the details of their local ‘Mind’ so help signpost her to sources of support instead of you telling them what you think is best. This way they know they are getting the best support possible but they also know you are there for them and they can talk to you about their issues.\n\n\nThe support that family and friends can give play a very important role for someone recovering from depression. Here are some more ways how you can help:\n\n## How to help someone struggling with depression\n\nYou can support people that you suspect are suffering from depression by encouraging people to start small and build up their energy levels, small amounts of physical activity has been proven to be extremely effective. Listening to them and just talking to them can help them talk through their issues and knowing that they have someone they can talk to is a huge step for anyone.\n\n\n*   Support them to get help in their own time. Don't force anyone to get help if they don't want it, but reassure them it's okay to ask for help if they need it and that there are plenty of people that want to help them.\n\n*   Be open about depression. Lots of people find it very difficult to open up about how they're feeling. If you are open about depression, your friends or family knows that it's okay to talk about whatever they're going through.\n\n*   Try and keep in touch. It can be hard for your friend or family member to have the energy to keep in touch. Even just a short text message or phone call, it will let them know that you are thinking of them and to them it can mean the world and make a big difference to how they feel.\_\n\n*   Don't be critical. If you put the blame on them, or too much pressure, it can make things much worse. Even if you may struggle to understand why they can't just snap out of it, the person that you are helping is probably being very critical and harsh towards themselves already.\n"
