    content: "## What is Gaming Addiction?\n\nThere have been some key stages of gaming addiction suggested, where initial exposure to a game starts the process to becoming addicted. Initial exposure to the game leads to a deeper interest, and then a growing obsession which then leads to addiction.\n\nGaming has both negative and positive effects on mental health. Gaming itself doesn’t have too many negative effects on mental health, however gaming addiction has been shown to be detrimental to mental health.\_\n\nGaming addiction has been recognised as an addictive behaviour by the World Health Organisation. They characterised it by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.\_\n\nIt is possible to be at risk of or developing an addiction to gaming in a similar way to other addictions to substances such as drugs or alcohol. Symptoms of gaming addiction include:\n\n*   Constantly thinking about or wanting to play the game\n\n*   Feeling irritable and restless when you’re not playing\n\n*   Lying about how much time you’ve spent playing or playing in secret such as in the middle of the night\n\n*   Tiredness, headaches or hand pain from too much screen time and the use of controllers or mouse and keyboard.\_\n\n*   Not paying attention to your personal hygiene, for example not washing often or not eating enough\n\n*   Not being able to quit or even play less of the game\n\n*   Having problems at work, school or home because of your gaming.\_\n\n*   Using gaming to ease bad moods and feelings\n\n## Initial Exposure\n\nInitial Exposure is when an individual has very positive early experiences with the video game, where the enjoyment and fascination with such a game develops very quickly. For example, they may have started playing Fortnite for the first time, their first ‘Battle Royale’ genre, which they instantly enjoyed and wanted to play more of.\n\n## Deeper Interest\n\nGaming begins to take up a significantly greater position in the individual's life, usually requiring a greater investment in time and money. Other activities that the individual might have done previously may be less significant to the person now. Developing a deeper interest into gaming is fine, it is how recreational gamers that have no intention of becoming esports professionals take that first step into esports.\n\n## Growing Obsession\n\nStarting to become obsessive over gaming is usually when large lifestyle changes occur. Increasingly neglecting relationships, sleep, nutrition often happens at this point as the great majority of the individual’s free time is now taken up with gaming. Their thoughts are becoming increasingly solely based around gaming.\n\n## Addiction\n\nGaming now has become the individuals dominant interest, with most of their free time taken up by gaming. They spend most of their day focused on it, either gaming or wishing they were when they weren’t. This can often be at the cost of academic or work progress and dietary and sleeping patterns are likely to be hugely affected by constant gaming. Slowly, they may find themselves disconnecting from the relationships around them IRL, and instead relying on the social connection that gaming brings.\n\nDespite this, recreational gaming rarely leads to addiction, it can be a harmless, healthy aspect of an individual's life. Often gaming is portrayed as this harmful activity that only children should do and we completely disagree with this portayal, however if gaming does become addictive, it can be caused by\_[mental health disorders](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=85).\n\n## Preventing Gaming Addiction\n\nIt can often be hard to identify when you are crossing the line between having fun with your hobby and getting to the point where you are addicted to gaming, but there are different things that gamers can do to make sure that they don’t become addicted to gaming.\_\n\n\n1.  By setting time limits for gaming and sticking to them, it prevents excessive gaming where you might sacrifice things like sleep and daily hygiene.\_\n\n2.  Try and do other activities every day including exercise, as this helps lower the health risks of sitting and playing for long stretches of time.\_\n\n3.  Set a sleep schedule and try and keep to it, don’t let gaming be a reason why you stay up late.\n\n## Negative effects that gaming has on mental health\n\nAlthough gaming has a lot of positive impacts on mental health, excessive playing of video games can result in a neglect of other aspects of your life. Apart from gaming addiction that we previously mentioned, excessive or unhealthy gaming habits may contribute to worsening of existing or underlying mental health problems, including:\n\n*   Emotional suppression:\_\n\n*   Anxiety and depressive symptoms\n\n*   Social disconnection\n\n*   Relationship issues\n\n*   Decreased motivation in school and work\n\n*   Dopamine addiction\_\n\nThese are some of the potential side effects of video games on mental health, though most of these can be avoided by following the advice suggested in\_[preventing gaming addiction](https://courses.awfullygood.org/mod/page/view.php?id=81).\n\n## Positive effects that gaming has on mental health\n\nGaming can help remove stress from everyday life by reducing thoughts on issues that you are dealing with on a regular basis, and help improve your mood.\_\n\nGaming is also great for social interaction with friends, combating social isolation where people might be more alone without many, if any friends, and can find people they have common interests with to create deeper friendships.\_\n\nGaming has also been shown to be a good distraction from IRL issues, giving a feeling of achievement. It is important to differentiate how the distraction can either give the feeling of escapism or coping, which both have varying effects on mental health. This feeling of escapism through the distraction that gamers find playing video games provides a relief from the unpleasant realities they may be experiencing IRL. However, escaping from these issues often are a precursor to developing depression tendencies rather than actually dealing with the issue they are having. Disengaging from the coping strategy has been found to cause negative outcomes such as increased stress and emotional suppression. However, using gaming as an effective coping strategy through problem solving and social connection and support has been shown to be effective in reducing stress and increasing emotional support.\n"

    content: "Being a point of contact for conversation about mental health can be very rewarding however it can also be time consuming and emotionally overwhelming. Often being part of a support network for someone who is struggling with their mental health can be stressful and take a toll on your own mental health, so it is important to be aware of this when you are offering support, and being in the right head space yourself.\_\n\nThink carefully about how you will look after your own wellbeing and make sure you also have an appropriate support system in place. Having someone that you can talk to about the issues you are dealing with is crucial for you to be part of someone else's support system.\_Discussing subjects or traumatic events that others close to you have experienced can have an impact on your own mental health, especially if you're feeling unwell.\n\nLearning self-care techniques and knowing what lifestyle choices affect mental health can be a great way to manage the symptoms of mental ill health. Also, by being able to recognise that you are struggling early, and then using these self-care techniques, it may also help prevent the problems from developing and getting worse. Just remember, it is unlikely that any of these will be an instant solution, recovering from a mental health disorder, or preventing one takes a lot of time, energy and work. So don't be hard on yourself.\n\n## Stay aware of your mental health\n\nTell people what helps. By letting the ones around you know what support you need from them, they can be more aware of how to help you with your mental health struggles. Whether it's as simple as them listening to you and talking to you, or being aware of your triggers, just telling them what you would like from them is a good way to help start a good support network.\_\n\nKnow your early warning signs. Try and be aware of how you are feeling daily, this can be done by keeping a mood diary or just taking some time to be reflective on how your day was. It can be useful to reflect on how you are feeling so you can access support as soon as you feel it's necessary.\n\n## Nourish your social life\n\nFeeling connected to other people is really important as it can help you feel valued and wanted, as well as helping increase self-confidence. If you can, try and spend some more time connecting with your friends and family. Gaming is great for developing friendships and social connection, gaming together with people, sharing that same combined interest is a great way to develop supporting friends around you. There are a lot of different discord communities that you can join if you are struggling to meet people, including our own GvD discord that you can access through our website.\n\n## Peer Support\n\nWhen experiencing mental health problems, it can feel like no one understands what you are going through, however peer support brings together people who’ve had similar experiences to support each other. Peer support offers a lot of benefits such as:\n\n*   Feeling accepted for who you are\n\n*   Increased self confidence\n\n*   Meeting new people and using your experienced to help others\n\n*   Fnding out new information and places for support\n\n*   Challenging stigma and discrimination\n\nPeer support groups are usually based locally, in the UK, Mind offer peers support groups, however, internationally it would be worth researching local peer support groups if you feel like it would help you.\n\n## Make time for therapeutic activities\n\nTherapeutic activities and techniques like relaxation, mindfulness and meditation can all be practised alone and help with your own mental health.\_\n\n*   Relaxation - Find something that helps you relax. This can be doing anything, for example, going for a walk or taking a shower but as long as it works for you, make sure you set aside time to do it.\_\n\n*   Mindfulness - Mindfulness is a therapeutic technique that involves being more aware of the present moment, both the world around you, for example, the temperature in your room, but also inside like your feelings and thoughts. Practising mindfulness can help you become more aware of your own moods and reactions, however this takes time to perform well, and it doesn't work for everyone.\n\n*   Meditation - meditation is an umbrella term for the many ways to a relaxed state of being. There are many types of meditation and relaxation techniques that are called meditation. Finding the right one for you can be really helpful. However, guided meditation is the most common and as the name suggests, you can be guided through the steps. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process may result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.\n\n## Look after your physical health\n\nBy looking after your physical health, it can help manage your own mental health too.\_\\*   Get enough sleep - make sure you try to set and keep to a sleeping schedule, this can help you have the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences.\n\n*   Keep physically active - regular exercise doesn't have to be very strenuous or high intensity to be effective. Simple and gentle exercises like going for a short walk can help keep you physically active. Exercise helps increase cortisol release, which helps us manage stress. It also makes us feel more tired at the end of the day which helps promote good sleep.\_\_\n\n*   Avoid drugs and alcohol - When struggling with mental ill health, it can often lead to a desire to use drugs or alcohol to deal with difficult feelings, however in the long run, they can make you feel a lot worse.\_\n\n*   Eat healthily - Getting 3 healthy, balanced meals a day, can make a big difference to how well you feel. Improving your diet may help to improve your mood, give you more energy, and help you think more clearly.\n"

    content: "You are not an expert, but it is important to care about your friends and the community around you. You can do this by asking people how they are feeling, pay attention to their response and ask how they would like to be supported.\_\n\nAvoid intrusive questions, treat everyone fairly and make yourself available just to listen. Empathise with them, listen and seek understanding of what they are going through but don't feel pressured to find them answers.\_\_\n\nFor example, if someone wants to speak to you about their mental health, ask them to tell you how they are feeling, appreciate that it is extremely difficult for them to speak about what they are going through and reassure them that it is positive that they want to talk about what they are going through.\_\n\nA good way to wrap up the conversation is to provide them with the details of their local ‘Mind’ so help signpost her to sources of support instead of you telling them what you think is best. This way they know they are getting the best support possible but they also know you are there for them and they can talk to you about their issues.\n\n\nThe support that family and friends can give play a very important role for someone recovering from depression. Here are some more ways how you can help:\n\n## How to help someone struggling with depression\n\nYou can support people that you suspect are suffering from depression by encouraging people to start small and build up their energy levels, small amounts of physical activity has been proven to be extremely effective. Listening to them and just talking to them can help them talk through their issues and knowing that they have someone they can talk to is a huge step for anyone.\n\n\n*   Support them to get help in their own time. Don't force anyone to get help if they don't want it, but reassure them it's okay to ask for help if they need it and that there are plenty of people that want to help them.\n\n*   Be open about depression. Lots of people find it very difficult to open up about how they're feeling. If you are open about depression, your friends or family knows that it's okay to talk about whatever they're going through.\n\n*   Try and keep in touch. It can be hard for your friend or family member to have the energy to keep in touch. Even just a short text message or phone call, it will let them know that you are thinking of them and to them it can mean the world and make a big difference to how they feel.\_\n\n*   Don't be critical. If you put the blame on them, or too much pressure, it can make things much worse. Even if you may struggle to understand why they can't just snap out of it, the person that you are helping is probably being very critical and harsh towards themselves already.\n"
