    subtitle: It's not all about face-to-face interactions.
    content: "There’s an assumption that living a healthy lifestyle involves eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly and getting adequate sleep. But social connection is rarely mentioned, even though it is pivotal to both our mental and physical wellbeing. [Research](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.3399889) suggests that loneliness is rising dramatically, and that an absence or lack of human connection could be more harmful to your health than obesity, smoking and high blood pressure.\_\n\nTrying to balance all the amenities of life such as work, school, hobbies and self care can take up the majority of our time. The resultant of this more often than not, is a reduction in social connection, but connecting with others is more vital to our well-being than you might think. [Social connection can reduce anxiety and depression, assist in regulating our emotions, increase self-esteem and empathy, and even improve our immune systems](https://cmha.ca/the-importance-of-human-connection/). Neglecting our inherent need to connect with others could be considered detrimental to our health.\_\_\n\nHuman connection isn’t the same for everyone though, people approach connecting with others in many different ways, and the levels of interaction you have can vary depending on the situation. Finding what forms of connection work for you is the first step to integrating more social connection into your lifestyle. It could be something simple like eating your lunch in a communal space, reaching out to an old friend you’ve lost touch with, joining a club, or trying a new activity.\_\n\nIn this modern World, technology has enabled us to be more connected than ever before, while simultaneously disconnecting us further from nature, ourselves, and each other. This paradoxical relationship can change for us all once we start using technology to enhance our social connection, and help us understand each other better.\n\nHere at Gamers vs Depression, we provide a multifaceted, diverse hub of information and interaction. From educational resources and workshops, to our community platform and Discord server; there are many ways to improve your social connection, and learn how to support others effectively.\_\n\nRemember, if you’re feeling lonely, you’re not the only one, and you don’t have to tackle it in isolation. We all need connection, so [join up](/sign-up), log in, and connect with fellow members of the GvD community. Together, we can change the game of mental health, while improving our social connection.\_\n"
