      1.  Our long\[er] course uses a virtual learning environment and splits
      the course into 8-modules. Each module has a range of reading and
      activities to complete. In total, the course can be completed in stages
      and will take around 2-hours to finish. To take the longer course, [click

      2.  Our short\[er] course is shared on YouTube and can be completed in
      under an hour. It combines the video content from each of the 8 modules
      and combines with four survey-based activities that will each take between
      90-and 250 seconds to complete. To take the short course, [click
