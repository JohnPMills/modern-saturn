    content: "Thank you for your interest in promoting Gamers vs. Depression. Since we launched in Mid-February 2022, we have had a lot of interest from fellow gamers and streamers wanting to help. We cannot tell you enough how much we appreciate the support and wanted to create this page to offer guidance on some of the initial ideas we have suggested.\n\n> Our main aim for the next few months is to develop our course enhancing gamer’s mental health knowledge.\_\n\nAs a non-profit, we are led by leading researchers and mental health experts. This means our programmes are based on the available evidence and rigorously tested. The more people who complete the course and provide feedback, the better we can make it. As such, the number one thing you can do to support us is to promote and take the course.\_\n\nYou don’t need to have experienced mental health struggles yourself as the course is all about developing your knowledge. We hope you never need the information shared, but if you, a friend, or teammate ever have an issue, by taking our course, you will be in a far better place to help.\_\n\n**If you fell and were hurt, you’d hope someone near by might know first aid, right? This is the similar.\_**\n\nWe understand everyone is busy and has different levels of motivation. This is why we have created short (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpC99qU7JwI) and long (https://gvd.gg/sign-up) versions of the course. The short course can be completed in an hour. The long course takes two hours but progress can be saved and modules split into various sittings. However, you like to learn, there is hopefully an approach that will work for you.\n\nYou can also support us in other ways. Adding the image below to your twitter header helps to raise awareness of the project. Adding ‘@gvdmentalhealth supporter’ to your bio also helps. Playing as our GvD branded car on Rocket League also helps us to raise awareness. Giving the project a shout out on your timeline or stream is another great way to help. Likewise, if you have an audience who might like to hear more about your story, we are interviewing gamers about how gaming affects their mental health. We also hope to create some merch in due course and love receiving videos and illustrations from you related to the course or project.\_\n\n![](images/1500x500.jpeg)\n\nIn summary, we really appreciate your help in getting our message out there. With over [three billion gamers worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/293304/number-video-gamers/) and 5-8% of people suffering from clinical depression in their lifetime, our rough calculations suggest that there are likely somewhere between 162 and 259 million gamers out there who are clinically depressed and hundreds of millions more who could use support. In other words, every time you play a game of Rocket League, FIFA, or any other online multiplayer game, at least one person in every match is likely struggling with depression. By taking our course and being an ally to our project, you’ll know what to do and say if you ever experience depression yourself or a teammate reaches out for support.\_\n"
