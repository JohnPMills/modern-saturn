        content: >
          At GvD, we strive to use gaming and esports as a vehicle to deliver
          Mental Health Literacy (MHL) programmes to young men around the World
          using unique, bespoke workshops. We also aim to reduce mental health
          stigma, increase help seeking behaviours in gamers and promote
          positive lifestyle changes that facilitate positive mental wellbeing.
          Our overarching goal is to equip gamers with the tools to manage their
          own mental health and the ability to help and support others.
